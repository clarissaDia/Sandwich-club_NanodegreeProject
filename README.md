# Sandwich Club Project

This project has been developed into the Android Developer Nanodegree by Udacity. 

The app shows a list of sandwiches and its detail once the sandwich is selected.

Beginning by downloading the [Sandwich Club app starter code.](https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code), the purpose of the app was to design the Layout of the detail Activity and practise with the JSON parsing.
